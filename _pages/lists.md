## List Grids 

To get the most functionality out of list grids in Skyve, switch into power user 
mode (from the top right hand corner, switch to power user mode if not already in there).

### Column Headings

![Column Headings]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/lists/ColumnHeading.PNG)

Column headings control sorting, you can do simple sorting by clicking
on the column heading. Clicking once will sort the list by ascending order, 
each following click will then toggle between descending and ascending. By
clicking the dropdown of a Column heading, you can choose to `Sort Ascending`, 
`Sort Descending`, `Configure Sort`, `Auto Fit` the column or `Auto Fit all columns`.
You can also choose which columns you wish to see using the `Columns` function, and Group
by the column selected.

If you wish to no longer have the list sorted, you can return the list to 
the default configuration by clicking on the menu item on the left hand side
that you clicked to get to your current screen.

### List Tools

![List Tools]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/lists/ListTools.PNG)

To use a more complex sort, you can use the `Configure Sort` tool previously 
mentioned. Click the drop down for any column heading and select `Configure Sort`.
You will now have the option to choose any number of ways to sort, you can 
add and remove levels of sort or rearrange them if you wish. Your configured sort 
will show a superscript number representing its priority in your sort, and the 
arrow will indicate whether the data is ascending or descending.

By clicking `Auto Fit`, the column width will automatically resize to show all 
information in that column. To resize all columns, click the `Auto Fit All Columns` 
button. To gain a little more room to view your query, you can click on the 
`Expand/Shrink Menu` button to minimise the side-menu.

### Filter Line

![Filter Line]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/lists/FilterLine.PNG)

The filter line has the ability to filter the list based on `like` or `contains` 
searches. Clicking the `Use Advanced Filtering` displays the `Advanced Filtering` 
section above the list. There are three styles of Advanced Filter: `Flat`, `Nested`
and `Inline`. Each perform the same use, but you may find one style easier to use 
than the others. Click the `Add` button to add new critera to filter by, then 
select the filter operator and enter the data you wish to find. 

### Export Data

To Export Data you can click on the `Export Table Data` button, the key areas of 
the wizard are; the report format, page formatting, margins and column selector. 
Your file will be generated and will appear in your downloads. To change the 
data shown in the export file, drag and drop between the two columns. If the report
is formatted, you can change the widths on the right hand side of the column.

### Flags

Flags are a useful tool for setting reminders or alerting others of something of 
note. To set a flag, click in the `Flag` column next to the record, then enter 
the text you wish to show and click `Flag`. The flag icon will show in the list and 
when hovered over will display the message stored. To clear the flag, click the flag
and click `Clear`. If you wish to search by contents in a flag, they can be filtered
just like any other field. 

### Summary Line

![Summary Line]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/lists/SummaryLine.PNG)

The Summary Line  in the bottom left corner can be applied to enact a number of summary functions on the data. 
There are functions to find the `Count` of the data, the average, the minimum and 
maximum, and the sum of any field.

### Snapshots

Snapshots allow you to save customisations to a list grid, such as advanced filters, custom 
sorting or column configuration. See [Snapshots]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}snapshots/).

### Tags

If you have a set of filters that you wish to reuse, you can use `Tags`. Once 
you have the filters set, click the `Tag` drop-down and click `New Tag`, enter the 
name of your tag and click `OK`. Click the drop-down again and hover over your 
newly created tag, from there you can select `Tag all in list` to tag all the items 
in your filter. At any point you can come back and select the tag you set, and filter 
by your previously set filter or the tags you set.
