## Using the Biz Hub support centre

The Biz Hub support centre is the best way 
* to create and lodge support requests to the Biz Hub team, and 
* to securely upload or download large files or sensitive data.

### Signing in

Once you have been provided with an account, open a browser an navigate to the [Biz Hub Support Centre](https://apps.bizhub.com.au), then sign in using your email address.

If you don't know, or have forgotten your password, use the `Reset your password` link at the bottom of the page.

### Creating a request

To create a request, press the `Create New Request` button at the top of the page.

Enter the request details and any attachments that may assist us to help you (attachments can be a zip of many files if required).

![Enter request details]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support-centre/new-request.png "Enter request details")

Once the details are complete, press the `Submit` button.

You will be returned to the current request list:

### Uploading a large or sensitive file

Rather than using unsecured email for sensitive data, or when the file is too large for email, use the secure drive feature of the support centre. The secure drive is only visible by your user, and our team. Files can't be seen by other users in your domain or organisation.

To upload a file to the secure drive:

* [Sign in](#signing-in) if you are not already logged in
* Select the `Secure Drive` menu item in the left-hand menu

![Secure drive]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support-centre/secure-drive.png "Secure drive")

* Select the file chooser button, or drag your file into the drag area.

![File chooser]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support-centre/secure-drive-upload.png "File chooser")

* Next, upload the file.

![Upload]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support-centre/secure-drive-file-chosen.png "Upload")

* Once the file is uploaded, close the upload pop-up.

### Downloading a file

Files in the secure drive are only visible by your user, and our team. Files can't be seen by other users in your domain or organisation.

If you have been notified to download a file from the secure drive:

1. [Sign in](#signing-in) if you are not already logged in
1. Select the `Secure Drive` menu item in the left-hand menu
1. From the `Files` area, select the file in the list to download and press `Download`
